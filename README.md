# AngularProject

Angular Project with MongoDB and Node.js Server

This project is an Angular application that interacts with a MongoDB database via a Node.js server. The Angular frontend communicates with the server to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data stored in the MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v20.11.1): Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- **Angular CLI** (v16): Install Angular CLI globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
- **MongoDB** (db version v7.0.7): Install MongoDB locally or use a remote MongoDB instance.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd <project-directory>
3. Install dependencies for the Node.js server:
cd <my-server>
npm install
4. Run the server:
npm start or node server.js
**Output:**
Server running on port 3030
Connected to MongoDB
If you don't get this output, then you probably have a problem with MongoDB.
5. Go to VS Code and open the Angular project (`bb-voyages` folder).
6. Open the terminal and run:npm i or npm install
7. Run the Angular frontend:
In another terminal in the project (`bb-voyages` folder) run: ng serve
**Output:**
Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200,
open your browser on http://localhost:4200/
